# Example project of generating OpenAPI specification and client

You'll find both a Back End and a Front End implementation here.

> ⚠️ Start the Back End first in order to be able to build the Front End!

## Example TypeScript + Express project with auto-generating OpenAPI specification

This project is a simple demonstration of how you can set up Node.js + Express + TypeScript, adding a special endpoint which generates an OpenAPI schema as well as displays it using Swagger UI.

## Example Angular + openapi-generator-cli for auto-generating OpenAPI client

This project is a simple demonstration of how you can set up an Angular + openapi-generator-cli. Don't forget to check out the [Back End](../backend/README.md) coupled to this project first.

> ⚠️ If you need to use something like this in production you can probably do a lot better than this demo, keep in mind it is as simple as possible for the purposes of demonstration.
